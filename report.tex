\section{Problem description}
% add the issues you detect. 
% In the Marathon, are enough resources for the runners? (WC, water sources, meals…), there are some unexpected queues, what about make the race on august?
We are provided with three marathon results, from a Keggle dataset, on the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. The data is structured in a way that we have the runners' information, the time they took to get to interest points and the time they took to finish the race. Some of the most relevant variables we are provided are: the age, the gender and the city of origin. We believe this characteristics have a direct impact on the performance of the runners.

By reading the paper \cite{b8}, we concluded that, effectivelly, enviormental conditions have a direct impact on the performance of the runners. The paper states that the temperature has a positive impact (longer races) and high humidity and high wind speed have a negative impact on the performance of the runners (faster races).

% Some ideas about this (since i do not know what the proffessor wants):
% - The temperature analysis only takes into account a small range of 5◦C to 24.5◦C, maybe results would be different if we consider hotter enviorments.
% - The wind speed analysis does not seem to explain wind direction. Maybe its usually the same direction in this place

\section{System description, introduction}
% Describe the system to be modeled (not the problem, not the data), other elements must be described on the subsequent sections of the document.
% Do we need to define what a system is?
The system to be modeled is the ``Barcelona marathon''. A system refers to ``A collection of entities, characterized by attributes, that act and interact together toward the accomplishment of some logical end''. 

In the Barcelona marathon we have runners of different levels and ages, that come from different cities and have different genres. The marathon is affected by environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature and wind speed. The runners need supplies such as water, food and medical supplies to finish the marathon. The purpose of the system is to ensure runners complete the marathon  while maintaining safety and competitivity.

This is a fairly simple linear system in which runners advance from one checkpoint to another. At certain points runners need to access resupply points which have limited capacities and an form queues if they aren't able to handle enough capacity. Runners advance from checkpoint to checkpoint until they reach the end of the race. The final times of the runners are also affected by environmental effects like temperature, rainfall and wind speed.

\section{Model specification}
% We will build a simulation model that represents a set of runners and how the climate conditions affect them.
% Clearly define the model entities, operations and processes that defines the behavior of the model. We must use here DEVS, Petri Nets or SDL, but since we are not going to use those formal languages, define a flow diagram to simplify the definition of the model. Since we are using GPSS you can use the GPSS icons of the language.

For this model, the entities and attributes are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Runners}: The runners are the main entities in the system. They have attributes such as age, genre and city of origin. They interact with the system by running the marathon.
    \item \textbf{Rainfall}: The rainfall is an environmental attribute that affects the performance of the runners. It has attributes such as intensity and duration.
    \item \textbf{Temperature}: The temperature is an environmental attribute that affects the performance of the runners. It has attributes such as intensity and duration.
    \item \textbf{Supplies}: The supplies are the resources that the runners need to finish the marathon. They have attributes such as water, food and medical supplies.
\end{itemize}

The oparations of the model will be reduced to runners arriving at the end line. The processes of the model will be the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generate runner}: The model will generate a runner .
    \item \textbf{Begins running}: The runner starts at the starting line and begins running.
    \item \textbf{Ends running}: The runner finishes the race.
\end{itemize}

In this procecss, the model will use a normal distributed random variable to determine the time it takes for a runner to finish. We created different time ranges to decide the level of a runner. The ``Elite'' runners tend to run 5 km in less than 18 minutes, the ``hobby'' runners take more than 18 minutes and less than 25 and ``new'' runners take more than 25 minuts.

The model purpose differs from the system purpose. We aim to predict the consequences of the environmental conditions on the performance of the runners. The model will help us understand how the rainfall, heat and other variables affects the performance of the runners.


% I need to know the time required for an elite male runner to finish the race. and then the female elite runner.

\subsection{Systemic Structural, Systemic Data and Simplifying Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SH\_01}: The runners will keep a constant speed over the race. Only the required time to finish the race will metter.
    \item \textbf{SH\_02}: Heat, wind and rain will be combined into a single value computed by a formula.
    \item \textbf{SS\_01}: The runners will be spleeted in three ``level'' groups based on the first 5 kilometers performance.
    \item \textbf{SD\_01}: The runners will not be affected by ethnics.
    \item \textbf{SD\_02}: The time is transformed with a logarithm function to make it more normal. The results are shown in the figure \ref{fig:elite_hobby_new_standar_deviation} and \ref{fig:new_qq}. The model will ignore the outliers.
\end{itemize}
