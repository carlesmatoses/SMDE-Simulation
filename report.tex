\section{Problem description}
% add the issues you detect. 
% In the Marathon, are enough resources for the runners? (WC, water sources, meals…), there are some unexpected queues, what about make the race on august?
We are provided with three marathon results, from a Kaggle dataset, on the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. The data is structured in a way that we have the runners' information, the time they took to get to interest points and the time they took to finish the race. Some of the most relevant variables we are provided are: the age, the gender and the city of origin. We believe this characteristics have a direct impact on the performance of the runners.

Reading the paper \cite{b8}, we concluded that, effectively, environmental conditions have a direct impact on the performance of runners. The paper states that the temperature has a positive impact (longer races) and high humidity and high wind speed have a negative impact on the performance of the runners (faster races).

% Some ideas about this (since i do not know what the proffessor wants):
% - The temperature analysis only takes into account a small range of 5◦C to 24.5◦C, maybe results would be different if we consider hotter enviorments.
% - The wind speed analysis does not seem to explain wind direction. Maybe its usually the same direction in this place

\section{System description, introduction}
% Describe the system to be modeled (not the problem, not the data), other elements must be described on the subsequent sections of the document.
% Do we need to define what a system is? I don't think so
The system to be modelled is the ``Barcelona Marathon''. This marathon involves runners of different skill levels, ages, and genders, coming from various cities. The event is influenced by environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature, all of which can impact runner performance. 

Runners rely on essential supplies, including water, food, and medical assistance, to complete the marathon safely. The course is structured as a linear system, where participants progress from one checkpoint to the next. Along the way, they encounter resupply points, which have limited capacities. If demand exceeds supply, queues may form, potentially delaying runners. Environmental conditions also play a significant role in the system, affecting both individual runner performance and the overall flow of the event.

In summary, the system comprises the marathon course, checkpoints, and resupply points, along with the interactions between runners, resources, and environmental conditions.


\section{Model specification}
% We will build a simulation model that represents a set of runners and how the climate conditions affect them.
% Clearly define the model entities, operations and processes that defines the behavior of the model. We must use here DEVS, Petri Nets or SDL, but since we are not going to use those formal languages, define a flow diagram to simplify the definition of the model. Since we are using GPSS you can use the GPSS icons of the language.

For this model, the entities and attributes are the following:

% TODO: esto esta mal, lo tendremos que ajustar a nuestro modelo
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Runners}: The runners are the main entities in the system. They have attributes such as age, genre, and city of origin. They interact with the system by running the marathon.
    \item \textbf{Rainfall}: The rainfall is an environmental attribute that affects the performance of the runners. It has attributes such as intensity and duration.
    \item \textbf{Temperature}: The temperature is an environmental attribute that affects the performance of the runners. It has attributes such as intensity and duration.
    \item \textbf{Supplies}: The supplies are the resources that the runners need to finish the marathon. They have attributes such as water, food and medical supplies.
\end{itemize}

The operations of the model will be reduced to runners arriving at the end line. The processes of the model will be the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generate runner}: The model will generate a runner .
    \item \textbf{Begins running}: The runner starts at the starting line and begins running.
    \item \textbf{Ends running}: The runner finishes the race.
\end{itemize}

In this process, the model will use a normal distributed random variable to determine the time it takes a runner to finish. We created different time ranges to decide the level of a runner. The ``Elite'' runners tend to run 5 km in less than 18 minutes, the ``hobby'' runners take more than 18 minutes and less than 25 and ``new'' runners take more than 25 minutes.

The model purpose differs from the system purpose. We aim to predict the consequences of the environmental conditions on the performance of the runners. The model will help us understand how the rainfall, heat, and other variables affects the performance of the runners.


% I need to know the time required for an elite male runner to finish the race. and then the female elite runner.

\subsection{Systemic Structural, Systemic Data and Simplifying Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SH\_01}: The runners will keep a constant speed over the race. Only the required time to finish the race will matter.
    \item \textbf{SH\_02}: Heat, wind and rain will be combined into a single value computed by a formula.
    \item \textbf{SH\_03}: Temperature wind and humidity change over the day, usually there is more wind later on the day than at morning, temperatures rise and humidity drops. The model will ignore this fact to eventually decreese as the sun gets down. The model will not account for this behaviour and will only take the average values of the day.
    \item \textbf{SS\_01}: The runners will be split in three ``level'' groups based on the performance of the first 5 km.
    \item \textbf{SD\_01}: The runners will not be affected by ethnics or age. An Elite runner with 70 years will be classified based on the time it takes to finish the first 5 km and not his status.
    \item \textbf{SD\_02}: The time is transformed with a logarithm function to make it more normal. The results of the shapiro-wilk test and the  figures \ref{fig:elite_hobby_new_standar_deviation} and \ref{fig:new_qq} show that only elite runners follow a normal distribution. The model will ignore the outliers.
    \item \textbf{SD\_03}: Temperature humidity and wind speed will be combined into three categorical variables (low, medium, high) based on the paper \cite{b8} shown on table \ref{tab:environmental_impact}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}
Temperature humidity are extracted from the years 1950 to 2019 from the meteorologic service of Barcelona. The wind speed is extracted from the same source but years 2007 to 2016.
Race times are extracted from the marathon results of 2015. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of each group: elite, hobby, and new runners. The results are shown in table \ref{tab:elite_hobby_new_mean_std_dev}.

\section{Results/Conclusions}
% NOT CONVINCED: The temperature effect may not be the most correctly used attribute of the enviorment. The effect of heat is based frm a range between 5 and 24.5 degrees, which is not a very wide range. The wind speed analysis does not seem to explain wind direction. Maybe its usually the same direction in this place.
